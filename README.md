## WordCloud

# What are Word Clouds?

Word clouds (also known as text clouds or tag clouds) work in a simple way: the more a specific word appears in a source of textual data 
(such as a speech, blog post, or database), the bigger and bolder it appears in the word cloud.

A word cloud is a collection, or cluster, of words depicted in different sizes. The bigger and bolder the word appears, the more often itâ€™s 
mentioned within a given text and the more important it is.


# Implementation 

The python script takes in a text file and uses standard processing to remove punctuations and uninteresting words. The output is a jpeg image with the word cloud
generated based on the frequency of words in the input file.
